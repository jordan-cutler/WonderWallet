# WonderWallet

### By: Jordan Cutler, Will Peracchio, John (Jack) Cunningham

This project was put together in a ~48 hour period during the LVHacks Spring 2018 Hackathon. 
The company challenge was to create a light cryptocurrency wallet that allowed users to download a keystore,
upload a keystore, send ether and a set of default ERC20 tokens, add more ERC20 tokens to trade with, and view 
your balance of each token. We were able to complete all of these tasks and add even a bit more flare with Wally our Wonderful Walrus!
